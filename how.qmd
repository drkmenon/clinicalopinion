## 2. Fill Out the Details Form
After payment, you will reach a protected form where you can provide:

- your diagnosis or question  
- your symptoms and history  
- upload X-rays / MRI reports / medical notes  
- your preferred email address for receiving the summary  

Your information stays private and is used only to prepare your summary.

## 3. Expert Review
An orthopaedic specialist reviews your uploaded reports and description.

They interpret the medical terms, understand the context, and prepare a clear explanation tailored to you.

---

## 4. Your Summary Is Prepared
The specialist writes a personalised, easy-to-read, plain-language summary.

This includes:

- what your diagnosis means  
- why it happens  
- what your tests show  
- treatment options in simple language  
- what questions you can ask your doctor next  

---

## 5. Delivered to Your Email
Your completed summary is sent directly to the email you provided.

Most reports are delivered within **24–48 hours**.

If you need clarification, you can reply to the email and ask follow-up questions.
