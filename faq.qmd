  <details>
    <summary>What is a plain-language illness summary?</summary>
    <p>It is a simple, clear explanation of your orthopaedic diagnosis written by an expert in everyday language. It helps you understand what the condition means without medical jargon.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Who prepares the summary?</summary>
    <p>An orthopaedic specialist reviews your information and writes the summary. It is not AI-generated. It is based on real clinical training and experience.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How is this different from searching online?</summary>
    <p>The internet gives general information, which may not match your actual condition. An expert summary is personalised, accurate, and explains exactly what your doctor meant.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How long does it take to receive the summary?</summary>
    <p>Most summaries are prepared within 24–48 hours after you submit all required details. You will be notified once it is ready.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this replace my doctor’s treatment?</summary>
    <p>No. This is an educational explanation to help you understand your diagnosis. It does not replace medical treatment, prescriptions, or emergency care.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I upload X-rays or MRI reports?</summary>
    <p>Yes, you can upload documents, scans, or reports through the form after payment. Only the expert reviewing your case can access them.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is my information kept private?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Your details and files are kept confidential and are used only to prepare your summary. They are not shared with anyone else.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I still have questions after reading the summary?</summary>
    <p>You can request a clarification or follow-up explanation. In future, optional video consultations may also be available.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What is your refund policy?</summary>
    <p>If you submit payment but do not receive the summary due to a technical issue or inability to review your case, a full refund will be provided. No refund is given once the expert summary is delivered.</p>
